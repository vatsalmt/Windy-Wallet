# 🌬 WindyWallet v3
### Chicago Loop Bill Optimizer — Built for Real People, Not Demo Portfolios

> Built as if you live at 233 S Wacker Dr and are tired of overpaying.

---

## What Changed in v3

### Logic & Accuracy
- **Mobile**: Only recommends plans that meet ALL your requirements (hotspot, intl, data, lines). Explains WHY the recommended plan works — network, coverage, caveats.
- **Internet**: Compares TRUE cost (monthly + equipment fee). Won't recommend anything below 60% of your current speed. Prefers plans with adequate upload speed for WFH.
- **Transit**: Real CTA break-even math ($105 pass ÷ $2.25/ride = 46.7 rides/month threshold). Suburb-to-Loop commuters get Metra logic. Rideshare users get the hard truth.
- **Insurance**: Never downgrades your coverage tier. Auto insurance surfaces usage-based options — Loop drivers average far fewer miles than the national average.
- **Discounts**: Based on real programs (Mint Military, T-Mobile First Responder, CTA Reduced Fare, Comcast Internet Essentials, ACA APTC credits). Shows which specific programs each discount unlocks.

### UX Improvements
- **Progress bar** in the header — real % completion, not just dots
- **Skeleton loading screens** — results page shows exact layout while analyzing
- **"Why this saves you money"** — every recommendation now explains the reasoning with impact levels (high/medium/low)
- **"Already optimal" explanations** — tells you exactly WHY your current plan is competitive, not just a generic message
- **Discount preview** — shows combined discount % live as you select eligible groups
- **Print + Copy Summary** buttons on results
- **Warnings** — e.g. "Xfinity promotional rate expires after 12 months — set a reminder"
- **Clickable ZIP shortcuts** on welcome screen
- Data freshness timestamp on every result card

### Data Quality
- Every plan has `notes[]` — multiple honest observations, not marketing copy
- `bestFor` field — who this plan is actually right for
- `caveats` — what the plan doesn't tell you upfront
- Transit data includes real CTA/Metra 2024 fare tables with break-even calculations
- Health insurance notes explicitly flag ACA subsidy eligibility
